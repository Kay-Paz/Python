# In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.”
# Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise:
# “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

# In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0.
# If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting,
# and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.


user_input = input("Enter a greeting:").strip().lower()

if user_input[0:5] == "hello":
    print("$0")
elif user_input[0:1] == "h" and user_input[1:5] != "ello":
    print("$20")
else:
    print("$100")
